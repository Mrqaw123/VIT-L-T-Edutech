# Smart Intrusion Detection System
I have simulated a smart intrusion detection system that
(a) continuously detects human movement in a restricted area using a PIR sensor,
(b) provides real-time alerts to security personnel via the cloud when motion is detected, indicating unauthorized access.
I have uploaded the following in the Project File:
• Aim
• Problem statement
• Scope of the solution
• Required components to develop solutions (Like software, Hardware and cloud
environment)
• Flowchart of the code
• Simulated circuit (Wokwi) and
• Video of the demo
